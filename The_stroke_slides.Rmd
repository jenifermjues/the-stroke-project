# Problem Statement and Questions {.smaller}

::: {width="40%" style="background-color: powderblue;"}
**Problem**

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. Early detection of stroke using prediction model can allow medical officers to provide immediate or efficient treatment that may minimize the long-term effects of a stroke and even prevent death.

**Questions**

1.  Which factors are important in predicting stroke?
2.  Which is the best sampling method for imbalanced data?
3.  Which is the best classification model (logistic regression and random forest) for stroke prediction?

## Data Story {.smaller}

Stroke takes up approximately 11% of death globally, according to the World Health Organization. Hence, the model that we have able to help for early detection whether someone is prone to have a stroke or not. Interestingly, we could see how age becomes one of the main factors that leads to higher probability of getting stroke.
